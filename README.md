# Assembler

This is an Assembler program that takes Assembly type code and compiles it to hexadecimal code (.obj), as well as .ent and .ext files for the external and internal variables.

This was my final project for computer Architecture and system programming laboratory class in Uni.

To compile the project execute the following command in the main folder:

```
make
```

Now you can run the program with the following command, supplying at least one command line argument:

```
assembler file folder/file
```

Which will compile the files **file.as** and **folder/file.as**, the outputted files will appear in the same folder.
